- Convert problem descriptions into formatted technical logs
- Suggest appropriate tags and categories
- Provide consistent documentation structure

### Smart Goal Assistant

Get AI assistance for creating SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals based on your engineering focus areas.

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```bash
# Gemini AI API Key for AI features
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

### Getting a Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file as `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd edt

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Run the development server
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
