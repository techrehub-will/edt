Build a Next.js web app for engineering teams to track personal development and technical project contributions.

Main Purpose:

Let individual engineers log their learning goals, resolved technical issues, improvement projects, and tasks.

Help teams or supervisors view summarized reports for performance reviews, audits, or mentorship.

Target Users:

Engineering graduates, trainees, and junior engineers working in manufacturing, utilities, automation, or energy.

Pages/Views:

Dashboard

Overview of current goals, open tasks, and recent project entries

Progress bar for development goals

Development Goals

Create, view, and update SMART goals

Mark goals as “In Progress,” “Completed,” or “Stalled”

Optional deadlines and progress notes

Technical Project Log

For each entry: date, title, plant/system affected, fault description, resolution steps, outcome

Upload images or diagrams (optional)

Tag by system (e.g., PLC, SCADA, hydraulics, solar)

Mini Improvement Projects

Log Kaizen-style initiatives or contractor-managed jobs

Include scope, justification, status, completion date

Reports/Export

Download PDF or CSV summaries of goals, logs, and projects

Filter by date, category, or status

Tech Stack:

Use Next.js (with TypeScript)

Backend: lightweight API or Firebase / Supabase for auth and storage

Optional: TailwindCSS for clean UI

Must-Haves:

Mobile-friendly layout

Editable entries

Dark/light mode toggle

Basic auth or Google login

The app should feel simple and engineer-focused—more like a journal than a corporate HR tool. Prioritize speed of data entry, offline usability (if PWA), and self-reflection.
